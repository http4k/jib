/**
 * http4k applications are just pure Kotlin functions. They are simple to write, understand and test!
 *
 * An HttpHandler is just a function which maps a Request to a Response
 *      typealias HttpHandler = (Request) -> Response
 *
 * Filters (or middleware) are functions which decorate HttpHandlers!
 *      interface Filter : (HttpHandler) -> HttpHandler
 *
 * The HTTP message model is immutable, so they are safe and easy to use.
